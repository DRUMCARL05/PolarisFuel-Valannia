## What is Polaris Fuel?

Polaris Fuel is a Web3 gaming community organization building **coordination infrastructure** for [Valannia](https://valannia.io) — a blockchain game featuring nine interdependent professions, racial territorial politics, and a Bitcoin-backed economy powered by `$VALAN`.

We're not here to flip. We're here to build the economic backbone that makes Valannia work for everyone — miners, crafters, transporters, guilds, and governance participants alike.

> *"The players who coordinate first control the economy first."*

---

## The Problem We Solve

Valannia's economy is complex by design:

- **Miners** need Explorers for maps, Engineers for protection, and Transporters to move materials safely
- **Crafters** need bulk raw materials but can't source them efficiently from dozens of small miners
- **Guilds** need organized voting power and economic velocity to influence Race Leader elections
- **Everyone** loses when the coordination layer doesn't exist

Polaris Fuel is that coordination layer.

---

## What We're Building

| Pillar | Description |
|---|---|
| 🏛 **Polaris Guildhalls** | Physical in-game presence in Valannia's racial capital cities — coordination hubs with premium tools for high-level guild negotiations |
| 🔥 **Fire & Metal Network** | Specialized transport and alchemy operations — moving raw materials from dangerous Red Zones to capital processing centers at scale |
| 💎 **Resource Exchange** | Escrow and matching services connecting solo extractors with bulk-buying crafters, closing the liquidity gap for Mega Constructions |

*More systems will be announced as Valannia launches.*
