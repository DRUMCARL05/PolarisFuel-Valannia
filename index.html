Let me check exactly what's still in English on the dashboard.The issue is that the **task names, category names, phase names, and milestone names** are all raw data strings baked into the CSV — they don't go through the translation system. I need to add Spanish translations for all of those data entries.

Let me build the full Spanish data set:Good. The fix is to add a Spanish CSV for both tasks and milestones, then swap which dataset is active when the language changes. Let me add that now:Now add the Spanish tasks CSV right after the English one:Now update the data initialization to swap datasets when the language changes:Now hook `reloadDataForLang` into the `setLang` function so data reloads when you switch:And make sure `reloadDataForLang` is called on initial render too:Let me verify there are no obvious issues:All references are wired up correctly. One issue: `reloadDataForLang` is defined after it's called on line 286. Let me fix that ordering:And update `setLang` to guard against `reloadDataForLang` not being defined yet (it's in the second script block):And make sure `reloadDataForLang` is called after login too:Good — but `reloadDataForLang` is in the second `<script>` block and `tryLogin` is in the first. Let me verify the call order is safe:`tryLogin` is in block 1 (line 260) and `reloadDataForLang` is defined in block 2 (line 460). Since `tryLogin` is only called by a button click — after both scripts have loaded — this is fine. Everything looks correct. Let me present the file:Upload this to replace `dashboard.html` in your repo. Here's what's now translated when you switch to ES:

- **All task names** — every one of the 60+ tasks
- **All category names** — Partnership Outreach → Contacto de Alianza, Beta Testing → Pruebas Beta, etc.
- **All phase names** — Week 1-2 → Semana 1-2, Launch → Lanzamiento, Post-Launch → Post-Lanzamiento
- **All milestone names and details** — gate criteria, dependencies, success indicators
- **Task descriptions and notes** in the detail modal
- **Status buttons** — Not Started / In Progress / Completed → No Iniciado / En Progreso / Completado

Task completion status is preserved across language switches using the English task name as the stable key in localStorage.
